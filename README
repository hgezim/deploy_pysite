A short bash script that allows you to easily build and install software packages (.tar.gz).

QUICK START:

1.) If you're not using virtualenvwrapper, set VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable to your absolute virtual environment path. If you are using virtualenvwrapper, just "workon" the virtual env. you wish to install the packages in.
2.) Add to, or remove from nonpip_packages and pip_packages arrays in SETTINGS section of deploy_pysite.sh source code. Use the formats specified in comments.

3.) (Optional) The default directory where software is downloaded and built is "$HOME/downloads". This is set in "dg_downloads_dir" in deploy_pysite.sh SETTINGS section. Feel free to modify it.

4.) Execute the script.
